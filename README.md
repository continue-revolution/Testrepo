# Testrepo
Test repository for VG101
I'm interested in my own html repository. It's my gift for my best friend, a pretty, nice girl. It's a simple web page written in html and less. It seems simple but it took me 7 days to learn and 2 days to make. I think I've been really thoughtful and that girl did consider my gift the most thoughtful one.
